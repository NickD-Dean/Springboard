# All materials and notebooks for my capstone project on Box Office Revenue can be found here. 


Business problem: Can I accurately predict the revenue of a given movie using models built using widely available data (downloaded from TMDB via Kaggle and corrected with data from IDMB's API)? 

All notebooks are directly related to and build up to my final modeling and report, with the exception of my IMDbPy Notebook, which I used to learn and orient myself to the IMDB Python package for extracting data from their API.
