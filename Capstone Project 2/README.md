# All materials and notebooks for my capstone project for Modeling Film Revenue can be found here. 

Objective: To apply multiple regression models to data acquired from TMDB and IMDB in order to predict movie revenue and conduct regression analysis using Python/Pandas/Sci-Kit Learn

Results: Used a tiered modeling approach using a gradient boosting model to predict film revenue and leveraged feature importance to visualize actionable insights on which variables impact revenue using Seaborn.  Identified and corrected over 600 incorrect revenue values in TMDB  data and corrected using the open-source IMDbPy API.

Notebooks are labeled with their 'version' number.  Initial attempt will be noted by "X.0" while the second attempt after identifying a mathmatical error that required a different approach are noted by "X.2".  

Future work including the use of clustering algorithms and improved feature engineering will be noted by "X.3" and is slated to begin in August of 2021.
