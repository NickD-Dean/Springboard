    "\n",
    "Both bring thousands of dummy variables and create a sparse matrix that must be used for modelling.  I have several other categories that increase dimensionality more than they should, from these I need to severely reduce the number of features that are present in my data.  I'll list the general approach for each here, and enumerate why I'm taking that approach in subsections below. \n",

    "**Release Year:** Bin by decade, reducing to 6 features\n",

As a starting point I'm going to eliminate all keywords that don't appear in in at least 50 films, which reduces this category by 7,123 dimensions to 11 features. \n",

    "I would prefer to bin keywords by quartiles as I'll do with production companies. This presents problems to stakeholders who would like to make predictions from this model for a film's revenue.  If keywords are binned by revenue, you need to consult the existing list of keywords to identify which quartile a keywords belongs to.  This by itself isn't a problem.  However, over half of all keywords appear in only a single film, and many are a garbled collection of symbols that are not interpretable. A single previous data point is not a good predictor of revenue, further compounded by the likelihood that a keyword has not appeared in a single film previously.  \n",
