    "The purpose of this notebook is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "First I want to reduce the dimensionality of my data set in order to make the machine learning models I have to work with more tenable. Currently I have over 10,000 features and only 2,333 observations in the data set, causing serious computational slowdown for my models.  Further, at the time when this notebook was initially written the machine I'm working on didn't have the computational power to even create dummy variables from my 'cast' and 'crew' categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to 'bin' categorical dummy variables into new features to reduce dimensionality.  This is relatively easy for features that are highly skewed (spoken language) or where each variable has a low frequency in the data set compared to 'None' (collection).  However I'll need to test performance on a basic linear/polynomial regressor for other categories where the data is exponentially skewed and there isn't a clear way to bin the data.  This will allow me to compare R^2 and Mean Absolute Percent Error metrics and determine which method for dimensionality reduction allows for the more accurate model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'll use Lasso and Ridge regressors to test my initial linear regressor for overfit; additionally I'll be able to use the Lasso regressor coefficients to determine what features can be dropped to further reduce dimensionality and complexity. "

    "To begin I want to significantly cut down on the number of features that I have in the data set.  By far the largest category that I have is Keywords, however the distribution of that category and several others presents several options for binning my data.  I can bin them into quartiles by either frequency or median/mean revenue in the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "However I do have several feature categories that I won't be touching: Genre, Release_year, Country, and Release_month.  These categories all have fewer than 70 individual features.  Additionally I have a compelling reason to believe that each of these will have a large impact on revenue.  Genre, Release_year, and Release_month all were significantly more evenly distributed across films than other categories.  For these three categories median revenue was also skewed towards certain sub-categories which indicates that they have an impact revenue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the Country category is **heavily** skewed towards films made in the United States, revenue is heavily skewed towards more 'exotic' countries.  This is likely a result of blockbuster films like 'Pirates of the Carribean' or 'The Avengers' being filmed on site in other locations.  I suspect that this category will be highly correlated with budget and may be dropped after I check Lasso regresor coefficients.  Regardless, this category only has 67 sub-categories and consolidating those into fewer bins will lose what appears to be useful information with minimal impact on reducing the 10,456 dimensions that the data set currently has.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that I need to bin the Spoken_lang, Company, Keywords, and Collection columns.  Later I'll come back through and treat the Cast and Crew categories the same as the Keyword category once I have access to a machine with enough RAM to handle those categories. \n",

At the same time the mean revenue for this data set is 2,500% of the smallest value.
