- **Objective:** To create useful customer segments from shopping data and accurately predict customer churn.

- **Results:** Provided three customer segments using a hierarchical clustering model with distinct behavioral patterns that also posessed unique demographic difference that allow the segments to be generalized and applied to customers for whom there is no transaction data.   Churn prediction modeling is in progress.
